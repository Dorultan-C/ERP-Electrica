# Known Issues & Fixes

## Mobile UI Issues

### High Priority
- [ ] **Notifications dropdown** - Too large for mobile screens, needs responsive sizing
- [ ] **Profile dropdown** - Not mobile-optimized, requires responsive positioning and sizing

### Implementation Notes
- Desktop versions work correctly - preserve existing functionality
- Need responsive Tailwind classes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes)
- Focus on touch-friendly targets and proper positioning
- Ensure dropdowns don't overflow screen boundaries on mobile

## Status
- Identified during Phase 2.3 completion
- Ready for implementation when mobile optimization phase begins
